4Ina is a lovely host and made us feel welcome from the beginning by wlecoming us upon arrival. She provides a lot of useful information about the region of Skye and her home is very close to both the Skype bridge and the Eilean Donan castle. We were very satisfied with our stay. Our only complaint is that the internet was a bit slow, the shower was off temperature, and that there was some clutter around the outside of the house. Other then that everything was great. Thanks Ina!
